Expressions in JSX

You can use these expressions in JSX by wrapping them with curly brackets {}.

Basic example


const title = <h1>You have {2 + 3} notifications</h1>;
This will create an h1 element with the text: You have 5 notifications.

See how the expression (2 + 3) gets executed and resolves to 5 which then gets replaced so that the final text is You have 5 notifications.
For it to work, expressions must be inside those curly braces.


- Variables

It's often useful to have variables in those expressions, for example, to show the user's name in the navbar:

const user = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Sam"
};

const element = <p className="user-info">Welcome {user.name}!</p>
This will create a p element with the text: Welcome Sam!.


- Function calls

You can also call functions inside those expressions, for example:

function capitalise(word) {
    return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.substring(1).toLowerCase();
}
const name = "brendan";

const element = <p className="user-info">Welcome {capitalise(name)}</p>
which will create a paragraph with the text: Welcome Brendan (notice how the B is uppercased).

Recap

An expression is any valid JavaScript code that resolves to a value
Expressions in JSX need to be wrapped inside curly braces: {expression}
<h1 className="title">You have {2 + 3} notifications</h1> is an example of JSX with an expression.
